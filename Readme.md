## üöÄ What is Los Mirlos Storytelling?

Los Mirlos Storytelling is a backend system that allows users to:
- **Generate original stories** from a short prompt
- **Continue stories** by guiding the next scene
- **Chat with characters** from the story
- **End a story** with a coherent conclusion
- Store and retrieve stories from the cloud

All this is handled through **serverless functions**, running on **Google Cloud Platform** using **Cloud Functions (Gen2)** ‚Äî making the entire experience scalable, stateless, and zero-maintenance.

## üß† How It Works

We use the [Gemini 1.5 Flash model](https://ai.google.dev) to generate structured story responses. Each story is stored as a JSON file in **Google Cloud Storage**, so stories can be retrieved, updated, and extended any time.

### üíæ Cloud Services Used:
| Service                  | Role                                      |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Cloud Functions**      | Serverless endpoints (story logic)        |
| **Cloud Storage (GCS)**  | JSON-based story persistence               |
| **Gemini API**           | Language model for storytelling           |
